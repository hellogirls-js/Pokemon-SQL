/*
Type Effectiveness

As a basic math and data retrieval exercise, you will calculate the
effectiveness of different types and type combinations.

You will start with retrieving the weaknesses and resistances for single types
then move onto calculating the total type multiplier for various type combinations.

All of the necessary information is stored in the type_chart table.

Good luck!
